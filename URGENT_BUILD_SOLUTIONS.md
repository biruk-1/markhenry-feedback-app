# Urgent Build Solutions - Get APK Faster!

## ⚠️ Current Situation
- Build is queued: ~120 minutes wait time
- Free tier has long queue
- Client needs it urgently

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION 1: Build Locally (FASTEST - 10-15 minutes)

### This builds on YOUR computer instead of waiting in queue!

### Requirements:
- Android Studio installed (or Android SDK)
- OR use Expo's local build option

### Option A: Local Build with EAS (Recommended)

**Run this command:**
```powershell
eas build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

**What happens:**
- Builds on your computer
- No queue wait
- Takes 10-15 minutes
- Requires Android SDK

**If you don't have Android SDK:**
- Install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
- OR use Option B below

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan (INSTANT - 2 minutes)

### Expo offers paid plans with priority builds:

**Free Plan**: 2+ hour wait
**Starter Plan ($29/month)**: Priority queue (5-10 min wait)
**Production Plan ($99/month)**: Even faster

### Quick Upgrade:

1. **Go to**: https://expo.dev/accounts/biruk123/settings/billing
2. **Choose**: Starter Plan ($29/month)
3. **Cancel after build** (if you want)
4. **Build starts immediately!**

**Note**: You can cancel subscription after getting your APK if you only need it once.

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION 3: Check Queue Status (Might be faster)

### Sometimes the queue moves faster than estimated!

**Check your build status:**
```powershell
eas build:list
```

**OR visit:**
https://expo.dev/accounts/biruk123/projects/mark-henry-ll152-gas-inspections/builds

**Sometimes builds complete in 30-60 minutes instead of 120!**

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION 4: Use Different Account (Won't Help)

### ⚠️ **This won't work!**

- New account = Still free tier
- Still same 2-hour queue
- Not a solution

**Don't waste time trying this!**

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Try Local Build First

### Step 1: Check if you have Android SDK

**Run:**
```powershell
where adb
```

**If you see a path**: You have Android SDK! ✅
**If error**: You need to install Android Studio

### Step 2: Build Locally

**If you have Android SDK:**
```powershell
eas build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

**This will:**
- Build on your computer
- Skip the queue
- Take 10-15 minutes
- Give you APK immediately

## 💡 QUICK DECISION GUIDE

### If you have Android Studio/SDK installed:
→ **Use Solution 1: Local Build** (10-15 min)

### If you don't have Android SDK:
→ **Use Solution 2: Upgrade Plan** ($29, instant)
→ **OR wait** (might be faster than 2 hours)

### If money is tight:
→ **Wait and check queue** (might complete in 30-60 min)

## 🔧 Local Build Setup (If Needed)

- Free but slow

→ **Upgrade to Starter Plan** ($29)

**If you can wait 1-2 hours:**
→ **Check queue status** (might be faster)

**If you have Android SDK:**
→ **Build locally** (free, 10-15 min)

---

## ✅ Summary

**Fastest**: Local build (if you have SDK) - 10-15 min
**Easiest**: Upgrade plan - 10-15 min (after upgrade)
**Free**: Wait in queue - 60-120 min (risky for urgent)
